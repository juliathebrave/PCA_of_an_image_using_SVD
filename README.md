Part of a Women in Data Science tutorial covering Dimension Reduction

[SVD_Blair.ipynb](SVD_Blair.ipynb) explores an image of Tony Blair using PCA/SVD.

[Blair.csv](Blair.csv) contains a preprocessed image obtained from the [dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-funneled.tgz) used in "Labeled Faces in the Wild".

[figure_1.png](figure_1.png) is an example of a figure that could be produced using the notebook.

The associated slide deck (authors @randirl17 and @juliathebrave) is found [here](http://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yUHj71GrG4FHMxnr7OGPNkh84fENkzngdVlxSIixYLs/).
